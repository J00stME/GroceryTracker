# GroceryTracker
Project 3 of Programming Languages SNHU course

The purpose of this project was to create a program that can read the frequency of words included in a text file.
Alongside this primary purpose was to allow for user input to choose how that information was displayed along with input validation to prevent crashes or improper input being accepted.

Moving forward, the user interface concept can be improved upon with GUI or other screen-writing methods.  If this were to be used for a business application, security such as encryption would be valuable when accessing the sensitive data involved.

The most challenging part of this project was reading data from a file.  This was made simple by using a map<string, int> to assign each item with its frequency.

This project made use of best-practices of object-oriented programming including try/catch statements for exceptions, inline comments, proper case for variables/functions which will make it easier to reuse this code and to conduct maintenance.
